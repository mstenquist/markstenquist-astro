					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						I began my career at a startup called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2011/04/25/campuslive-raises-3-1-million-to-help-brands-connect-with-college-students/" target="_blank" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-700 font-semibold hover:underline">CampusLIVE</a>. My older brother was the founder and I was part of the small team that helped grow the company, eventually going on to raise millions from some prominent venture capital firms. This early experience taught me how to design and build products while navigating the chaos of startup life in 2010. Through this experience I got a crash course in web design and development due to my love for all things design and technology.
					</p>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						In 2013, I joined a Google Ventures backed startup called <a href="https://venturebeat.com/entrepreneur/custom-goods-marketplace-custommade-cooks-up-18m-from-google-atlas-others/" target="_blank" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-700 font-semibold hover:underline">CustomMade</a> where I honed my JavaScript skills to create beautiful interfaces for interactions between the maker and buyer. There I was fortunate enough to work under the leadership of Mike Salguero (Now CEO and founder of Butcher Box). When that chapter closed in 2015, instead of taking a job at Wayfair I ventured out as an independent consultant, primarily serving Boston-based startups. This period was incredibly rewarding, I met a ton of new people, expanded my network and got to work on some really interesting challenges. Some of these early companies include: Love Pop, Booster, BevSpot, SessionM, Quilt, Mable, VentureApp (Now HqO) etc.
					</p>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
						During the COVID lockdown, these experiences and connections led me to co-found <a href="https://visualboston.com" target="_blank" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-700 font-semibold hover:underline">VisualBoston</a>, where I lead the engineering side of our digital agency.
