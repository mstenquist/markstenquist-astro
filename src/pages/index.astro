				<h2>🚀 My Journey</h2>
				<p>
					I started my career by joining the founding team of a college startup out of UMass Amherst started by my older brother. We grew the company, eventually raising millions from prominent Boston VCs. This early experience taught me how to build products while navigating the exciting chaos of startup life.
				</p>
				<p>
					Later, I joined a Google Ventures backed startup (think Etsy for high-end furniture and jewelry) where I honed my skills creating beautiful, functional digital experiences that connected artisans with customers.
				</p>
				<p>
					When that chapter closed in 2015, I ventured out as an independent consultant, primarily serving Boston-based startups. This period was incredibly rewarding—meeting new people, expanding my network, and solving diverse technical challenges across different industries.
				</p>
				<p>
					During the COVID lockdown, these experiences and connections led me to co-found VisualBoston, where I lead the engineering side of our digital agency.

				<h2>💻 Technical Foundation</h2>
				<p>
					My expertise lies in frontend engineering (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), developed through multiple roles at venture-backed startups. I'm passionate about creating digital products that combine thoughtful design with high-quality engineering.
				</p>
				<p>
					I'm obsessed with combining my deep technical experience developing user interfaces with generative AI to rapidly prototype and build new app ideas.
				</p>

			<section class="interests">
				<h2>🌱 Beyond Technology</h2>
				<p>
					When I'm not building digital experiences, you'll find me working in the garden. I hold a Permaculture Design Certificate and would love to see a world that values transforming landscapes into thriving ecosystems that provide fresh food for family, friends, and neighbors.
				</p>
				<p>
					I also play guitar to unwind and find creative inspiration offline.
