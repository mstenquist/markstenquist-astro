				<h2 class="text-section-heading">A bit about me</h2>
				<p class="text-body">
					My journey began on the founding team of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2011/04/25/campuslive-raises-3-1-million-to-help-brands-connect-with-college-students/" target="_blank" class="link-enhanced">CampusLIVE</a> at UMass Amherst, a college startup that grew from dorm room idea to a multi-million dollar company backed by <a href="https://hcp.com" target="_blank" class="link-enhanced">Highland Capital Partners</a> and <a href="https://www.crv.com/" target="_blank" class="link-enhanced">CRV</a>. This early experience didn't just teach me how to code; it showed me how technology can scale human connections and create real business value.
				</p>
				<p class="text-body">
					At Google Ventures-backed <a href="https://venturebeat.com/entrepreneur/custom-goods-marketplace-custommade-cooks-up-18m-from-google-atlas-others//" target="_blank" class="link-enhanced">CustomMade</a>, I grew my the frontend skills and used them to help them connect thousands of artisans with customers seeking custom furniture and jewelry. I learned that great user interfaces aren't just about clean code, they're about understanding user psychology, reducing friction, and building trust through digital experiences.
				</p>
				<p class="text-body">
					After CustomMade, I spent the next five years as an independent consultant, working with dozens of Boston-area startups across industries from fintech to healthcare and beyond. Each project taught me something new about solving complex technical challenges while meeting aggressive business timelines.
				</p>
				<p class="text-body">
					In 2020, these experiences and connections led me to co-found <a href="https://visualboston.com" target="_blank" class="link-enhanced">VisualBoston</a>, where I lead engineering for our digital agency. We've grown from a pandemic pivot to a thriving team that helps ambitious companies build their digital presence.

				<h2 class="text-section-heading">Technical Foundation</h2>
				<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-primary mb-4">Core Expertise & Technical Stack</h3>
				<p class="text-body">
					My 15+ years in frontend engineering span the evolution from jQuery to modern frameworks. I specialize in:
				</p>
				<ul class="mb-6 text-secondary leading-relaxed">
					<li class="mb-2"><strong>Frontend Architecture</strong>: React, Vue, Angular, and vanilla JavaScript for high-performance applications</li>
					<li class="mb-2"><strong>Modern Development</strong>: TypeScript, Node.js, Progressive Web Apps, and JAMstack architectures</li>
					<li class="mb-2"><strong>Performance Optimization</strong>: Core Web Vitals mastery, load time optimization, and mobile-first responsive design</li>
					<li class="mb-2"><strong>AI Integration</strong>: Combining traditional frontend development with generative AI for rapid prototyping and enhanced user experiences</li>
				</ul>
				<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-primary mb-4">What Sets Me Apart</h3>
				<p class="text-body">
					I obsess over creating seamless experiences on the web. Having worked at venture-backed startups, I understand the pressure to ship fast while building for scale. I've led technical decisions that supported 10x user growth, optimized applications serving millions of requests, and mentored development teams through complex product launches.
				</p>
				<p class="text-body">
					My current obsession is the intersection of AI and frontend development. I'm building tools and workflows that leverage generative AI to accelerate the design-to-code process, automate repetitive development tasks, and create more intuitive user interfaces. This isn't just about using ChatGPT to write code. It's about fundamentally rethinking how we build digital products.

				<h2 class="text-section-heading">Beyond Technology</h2>
				<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-primary mb-4">Growing More Than Code</h3>
				<p class="text-body">
					When I step away from the screen, you'll find me in the garden with my hands in the soil. I hold a Permaculture Design Certificate and am passionate about regenerative agriculture practices. My current project is transforming our quarter-acre lot into a productive ecosystem that supplies fresh vegetables, herbs, and fruit for our family and neighbors.
				</p>
				<p class="text-body">
					Permaculture principles have actually influenced how I approach software development. Both involve designing sustainable systems, understanding interconnected relationships, and creating solutions that improve over time. Whether I'm planning a garden bed or architecting an application, I'm thinking about long-term sustainability and beneficial relationships between components.
				</p>

			<section class="section-card reveal-stagger">
				<h2 class="text-section-heading">Ready to Build Something Great?</h2>
				<p class="text-body">
					I work with forward-thinking companies and ambitious entrepreneurs who understand that exceptional digital experiences drive business results. Whether you need a technical co-founder, a frontend architect for your next big feature, or a consulting partner to help navigate complex development challenges, I'd love to explore how we can work together.
				</p>
				<p class="text-body">
					<strong>Current availability:</strong> I take on 1-2 strategic consulting projects per quarter alongside my work at VisualBoston.
