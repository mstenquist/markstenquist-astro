				<h2>A bit about me</h2>
				<p>
					I started my career by joining the founding team of a college startup out of UMass Amherst called CampusLIVE which was founded by my older brother. We grew the company, eventually raising millions from prominent Boston VCs including <a href="https://hcp.com" target="_blank">Highland Capital Partners</a> and <a href="https://www.crv.com/" target="_blank">CRV</a>. This early experience kickstarted my love of entreprenuership and taught me much of what I know now.
				</p>
				<p>
					Later, I joined a Google Ventures backed startup called <a href="https://venturebeat.com/entrepreneur/custom-goods-marketplace-custommade-cooks-up-18m-from-google-atlas-others//" target="_blank">CustomMade</a> (think Etsy for high-end furniture and jewelry) where I honed my skills creating beautiful, functional digital experiences that connected artisans with customers.
				</p>
				<p>
					When that chapter closed in 2015, I ventured out as an independent consultant, primarily serving Boston-based startups. This period was incredibly rewardingâ€”meeting new people, expanding my network, and solving diverse technical challenges across different industries.
				</p>
				<p>
					During the COVID lockdown, these experiences and connections led me to co-found VisualBoston, where I lead the engineering side of our digital agency.

				<h2>ðŸ’» Technical Foundation</h2>
				<p>
					My expertise lies in frontend engineering (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), developed through multiple roles at venture-backed startups. I'm passionate about creating digital products that combine thoughtful design with high-quality engineering.
				</p>
				<p>
					I'm obsessed with combining my deep technical experience developing user interfaces with generative AI to rapidly prototype and build new app ideas.

				<h2>ðŸŒ± Beyond Technology</h2>
				<p>
					When I'm not building digital experiences, you'll find me working in the garden. I hold a Permaculture Design Certificate and would love to see a world that values transforming landscapes into thriving ecosystems that provide fresh food for family, friends, and neighbors.
				</p>
				<p>
					I also play guitar to unwind and find creative inspiration offline.
